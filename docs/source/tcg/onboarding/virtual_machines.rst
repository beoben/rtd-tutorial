Virtual Machines
================

Most all of the TCG Digital development projects are hosted on any number of our many VM's via AWS. TCG Digital has created a webpage to allow team members to 'checkout' and 'stop/start' VM's for different purposes.

- `Access the AWS Self Service Dashboard <https://solutions.tcgdigital.com/aws_selfservice/home>`_

- Use Ctrl+F to find your desired VM by name (this should be provided to you. If not, reach out to your supervisor).

- Select the 'Checkout' toggle to 'check out' the VM. This is so that other VM users can see that you are still using the VM. If you don't check in then others will not know you are using it, and may stop the server while you are still connected. A page reload may be required.

- Once you are checked in:

  - If the "Current status" indicator is red, the VM is off. Select the "Start/Stop" toggle and wait for it to load (This can take a while, so go grab a coffee). A page reload may be required.

  - If the "Current status" indicator is green, the VM is on, and you can enter MCube via the links below.

- With the VM running, you can then access the contents of the VM. Normally you will be provided a link for the project you are working on that will connect directly to the running VM instance. If you do not have this link, reach out to your supervisor.

- When you are finished:

  - If you are the last person checked-in to the VM, click the 'start/stop' toggle BEFORE checking out.
  
  - If you are NOT the last person checked-in to the VM, then just checkout, leaving it running for the other users.

.. NOTE:: 

   As long as the 'Current Status' is green, then we are being billed by AWS for that VM!
